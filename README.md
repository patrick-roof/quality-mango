## Description

This application is entirely backend, for now. It is designed to allow for users to be created, as well as thoughts that are assigned to those users. It uses mongoose and express. In Insomnia or other similar applications, you can test the different routes and create, read, update, and delete different users and thoughts. During this project I have expanded my knowledge of monodb, and routes especially.
